# ``ApplicationProtobuf``

Protocol buffer support for HE applications, including `PrivateInformationRetrieval` and `PrivateNearestNeighborSearch`

## Overview
`ApplicationProtobuf` contains supports for using [PrivateInformationRetrieval](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-homomorphic-encryption/main/documentation/privateinformationretrieval) and [PrivateNearestNeighborSearch](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-homomorphic-encryption/main/documentation/privatenearestneighborsearch) with [protocol buffers](https://protobuf.dev/), commonly referred to as `protobuf`.
This module contains:
* the generated Swift code to use the protobuf types.
* conversion between protobuf types and [PrivateInformationRetrieval](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-homomorphic-encryption/main/documentation/privateinformationretrieval) runtime types.
* conversion between protobuf types and [PrivateNearestNeighborSearch](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-homomorphic-encryption/main/documentation/privatenearestneighborsearch) runtime types.

The protobuf schemas are defined at [https://github.com/apple/swift-homomorphic-encryption-protobuf](https://github.com/apple/swift-homomorphic-encryption-protobuf).
