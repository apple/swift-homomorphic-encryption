# ``PrivateNearestNeighborsSearchProtobuf``

Protocol buffer support for [PrivateNearestNeighbors](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-homomorphic-encryption/main/documentation/privatenearestneighbors)

## Overview
`PrivateNearestNeighborsProtobuf` contains supports for using [PrivateNearestNeighbors](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-homomorphic-encryption/main/documentation/privateinformationretrieval) with [protocol buffers](https://protobuf.dev/), commonly referred to as `protobuf`.
This module contains:
* the generated Swift code to use the protobuf types.
* conversion between protobuf types and [PrivateNearestNeighbors](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-homomorphic-encryption/main/documentation/privatenearestneighbors) runtime types.

The protobuf schemas are defined at [https://github.com/apple/swift-homomorphic-encryption-protobuf](https://github.com/apple/swift-homomorphic-encryption-protobuf).
