# Examples

Examples for how to use ``HomomorphicEncryption``

### Basics
We start with the basics.
@Snippet(path: "swift-homomorphic-encryption/Snippets/HomomorphicEncryption/BasicsSnippet", slice:"encryption")

We also have async APIs.
@Snippet(path: "swift-homomorphic-encryption/Snippets/HomomorphicEncryption/BasicsAsyncSnippet", slice:"encryption")

### HE Addition and Subtraction
Continuing from the previous example, we can also compute on the encrypted data.
We can add a ciphertext with a ciphertext or a plaintext.
@Snippet(path: "swift-homomorphic-encryption/Snippets/HomomorphicEncryption/BasicsSnippet", slice:"addition")

Continuing from the previous example, we can also subtract a ciphertext by a ciphertext or a plaintext.
@Snippet(path: "swift-homomorphic-encryption/Snippets/HomomorphicEncryption/BasicsSnippet", slice:"subtraction")
